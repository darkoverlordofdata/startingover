# startingover

Why? Because after reinstalling windows10 and MSys2, my opengl projects no longer cmpile due to an unresolved symbol 'typedef ptrddif_t' in glew.

This does give me pause regarding the fragile nature of OpenGL - and makes we wonder if this isn't a good reason to eschew it in favor of SDL2...
